Still approaching the task on an intellectual level, Sheldon decides to use traditional friend making approaches, such as going out for food, for a hot beverage or to participate in a common interest.

The only person among her friends she has divulged the information to is Bernadette, who in turn has told Penny and Leonard. This relationship secret, which now sits with four of them, is only the tip of the iceberg in relationship secrets where one or two people within the group know a secret about someone else, with all these secrets potentially coming to light, each with their own consequences, all them having some connection to trust, or lack thereof, within the relationship.
